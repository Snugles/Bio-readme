# Hello!
Just a simple UK nerd who likes to create. Love working Back-end mostly but I am known to indulge in some good React.js often as well.
Big fan of JavaScript, React, Express, SQL (both PostgreSQL and MySQL), Mongo and good old Node, although I'm always on the lookout for new tech adventures.

I also make games in unity with C# occasionally but that's just for fun.
